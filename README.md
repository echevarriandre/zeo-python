# Zeo-python

Python script version of [Zeo](https://github.com/xadden/zeo) but only with the sorting functionality. It only supports 1080p for now.
Since HorribleSubs has shutdown in the meantime this project now uses Erai-raws.

## First time running
When running for the first time it is required to specify where the downloaded files are and where to save them by using arguments.

Use -h or --help for help.

## Following runs
After running the first time, just execute the script and it will automatically sort.

If you wish to change the folder paths, use the arguments again.

## New features
It supports ~~HorribleSubs~~ Erai-raws batches which the original Zeo doesn't.
